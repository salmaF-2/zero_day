##Learning Objectives
I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google
###General
*  A virtual machine (VM) is a software environment that mimics a physical machine, enabling multiple operating systems or applications to run on a single physical machine.
* Vagrant is a tool used for building and managing virtual machine environments. It provides an easy-to-use command line interface for managing virtual machines and automates the process of creating and configuring them.
* Vagrant was created by Mitchell Hashimoto, an American software engineer and entrepreneur.
* Ubuntu is a popular Linux-based operating system that is known for its user-friendly interface and ease of use.
* "Ubuntu" is a South African word that means "humanity towards others" or "I am what I am because of who we all are."
* To use VMs with Vagrant, you first need to install Vagrant on your local machine. Then, you can use the Vagrant command line interface to create, configure, and manage virtual machines on your local machine or on a remote server.
* The command uname is used to display certain system information about the operating system and machine hardware, including the operating system name, version, and hardware architecture. It is commonly used in Unix-like operating systems like Linux and macOS.
